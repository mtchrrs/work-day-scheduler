# work-day-scheduler

Busy today? Who isn't. I bet you've got a lot of projects on, a lot of work at the same time, wouldn't it be nice to see what your day looks like? Welcome.

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively


## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule

WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day

THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist


## Using the Application

Deployed Application URL: https://mtchrrs.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

The purpose of this application is to manage your day, to plan out events and structure to allow for maximum efficiency.

When first opening the application, users will be presented with the following screen

Users are presented with the current day, date and time at the top of the page.

To input data, first find the desired time-slot, and then click in the middle column and type what you would like to see appear in this section.

Remember to save this input! If you do not save it, it will not be kept in the browser (note: pressing the enter key starts a new line, it does not save the input)

During the work day, the scheduler will track the hours remaining through visual effects, meaning that past, present and current time slots will each differ in colour.
As you can see in the following image, the colour of the past time-slots is light grey, the current time will be shown as red, and future time is green.

If you reload the screen, your items will be saved, thus allowing for you to continue your work day and revisit in an hour or so to check the planner!
