Remember to save this input! If you do not save it, it will not be kept in the browser (note: pressing the enter key starts a new line, it does not save the input)

During the work day, the scheduler will track the hours remaining through visual effects, meaning that past, present and current time slots will each differ in colour.
As you can see in the following image, the colour of the time-slot is light grey, this represents past time, as I am completing this read me after 5pm.

Current time will be shown as red, and future time as green, however you will have to try the application for yourself to see these effects!
If you reload the screen, your items will be saved, thus allowing for you to continue your work day and revisit in an hour or so to check the planner!
